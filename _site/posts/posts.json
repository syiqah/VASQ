    "contents": "\r\n1 Critic\r\nWe will critic the following data visualisation based on clarity and aesthetic.\r\nSource: Department of Statistics, Singapore1.1 Clarity\r\nThe visualisation lacks a main title. User must click on the source link of the visualisation to access the original visualisation on the Department of Statistics, Singapore website to learn that the visualisation is of merchandise trade performance with major trading partners in 2020. Ideally, the static visualisation should include the title so that the user can understand at one glance the purpose and scope of the visualisation, instead of having to read the notes or click to the original visualisation webpage.\r\nLack of definition for “Total merchandise trade value”. “Total merchandise trade value” is not clearly defined as the sum of export value and import value, for each trading partner. This should be distinguished from “trade balance”, which is the difference between export value and import value, for each trading partner.\r\nThe shaded regions “Net Exporters” (in green) and “Net Importers” (in blue) are misleading. The note to the visualisation explains that “if the value of imports exceeds exports, the centre point of the bubble falls in the “Net Importers”… blue region”. Take for example Taiwan - intuitively, if Singapore’s value of imports from Taiwan exceeds the value of exports to Taiwan, Taiwan is a net exporter to Singapore and should not be labelled as a net importer. Conversely, if Singapore’s value of exports to Hong Kong exceeds the value of imports from Hong Kong, Hong Kong is a net importer from Singapore and should not be labelled as a net exporter. Therefore, the shaded regions should be revised to “Net exports from Singapore” (in green) and “Net imports from Singapore” (in blue)\r\nLack of definition for EU. Nine of the trading partner bubbles refer to Singapore’s trading partner countries or regions but “EU” is the only bubble that is an aggregation of merchandise trade with 27 countries in the European Union. While we can appreciate the relevance of comparing the European Union as a trading partner vis-à-vis the other nine countries, the member countries of the European Union should be clearly listed.\r\nMissing units for both axes. The graph is missing the basic requirement for axes to be clearly labelled with the counting unit. User must look at the bubble annotations to understand that the axes are in billion Singapore dollars.\r\nUnclear context of information box. At the bottom of the visualisation, there is an information box commenting on the trend of exports exceeding imports with Mainland China since 2009 and trend of imports exceeding with the United States since 2006. This information is not meaningful for the user reading the static visualisation for 2020. It would be more meaningful to include at least the 2006 and 2009 data for visualisation with a slope graph.\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nSmaller bubbles hidden by larger bubbles. The “total merchandise trade value” bubbles are too opaque so trading partners with smaller total merchandise trade values are hidden behind those with larger total merchandise trade values. By making the bubbles more translucent, they can overlap each other while remaining at their respective positions on the graph.\r\nLabels of both axes are not intuitive. The labelling of “Exports” and “Imports” axes with icons at the zero-origin are confusing. User has to double-check that the label “Exports” refer to the x-axis and “Imports” refer to the y-axis. Typically, the word “Export” should appear along the x-axis and “Imports” along the y-axis for ease of reading and simple intuition.\r\nAbsence of reference lines. It is challenging for user to read the export and import value of a specific trading partner. Even when user hovers pointer over the original interactive visualisation to bring forward the bubble (e.g. European Union), it is still difficult to read the exact export and import values.\r\n2 Alternative data visualisation\r\nWe propose an alternative interactive data visualisation to strengthen the visualisation in terms of clarity and aesthetics.\r\n2.1 Sketch\r\nA brief sketch of the proposed alternative data visualisation is as follows:\r\nCredit: Student assistant, Chong Zhan Han2.2 Advantages of alternative data visualisation\r\nGraphical design principles\r\nA dynamic title is given to the visualisation, which follows the “Year” radio button when toggled.\r\nThe axes are labelled per normal convention to avoid confusion for the user.\r\nThe top left triangular region of the graph is labelled as “Negative trade balance” and the bottom right triangular region of the graph is labelled as “Positive trade balance”. This is to mitigate the “Net importers” and “Net exporters” confusion created by the original visualisation.\r\nThe “trade value” bubbles are more translucent such that smaller bubbles are not hidden by larger bubbles.\r\nReference lines are added if user wishes to estimate the exact export or import value Singapore made with a trade partner. Otherwise, the user may rely on tooltips for detailed information.\r\nA note is added at the bottom of the visualisation that unlike the other nine trade partners, the European Union comprises 27 countries.\r\n\r\nStatistical graphic methods\r\nThe “trade value” bubbles are now proportionally-sized, unlike the original visualisation that exaggerated the trade value of Mainland China in relation to the other trade partners.\r\n\r\nInteractive techniques (including animation)\r\nTooltips are provided such that when user hovers over the edge of a “trade value” bubble, detailed information on Singapore’s trade value and trade balance.\r\nWe have incorporated a slow-speed animation for user to see the trade value bubble for a trade partner change in relative size and position on the graph when the user toggles the “Year” radio buttons. User can also see more than one trade partner’s movement each time the “Year” radio button is toggles and this facilitates a convenient high-level comparison of trade partners.\r\n\r\n2.3 Proposed data visualisation (in Tableau)\r\nUsing Tableau 2021.1, the alternative data visualisation is available for viewing in Tableau Public. A snapshot of the dashboard is as follows:\r\n\r\n3 Step-by-step guide to prepare data visualisation\r\nDownload the dataset from the Department of Statistics Singapore’s website on Merchandise Trade. Expand the “Merchandise Trade by Region/Market” tab and click on “Download all in Excel”. Retain the file name as “outputFile.xlsx”.\r\n3.1 Data preparation in Tableau Prep\r\nOpen Tableau Prep Builder 2021.1 and click on “Connect to data” button. Next, select “To a File: Microsoft Excel”.\r\n\r\nLocate the unzipped file “outputFile.xlsx” and click OK.\r\n\r\nCheck the “Use Data Interpreter” box to perform preliminary cleaning on the dataset.\r\n\r\nClick and drag “T1” table into the “Add Data” workspace. Right-click on the “T1” node and rename it to “Import”.\r\n\r\nClick on the “+” button of the “Import” node and select “Clean Step”.\r\n\r\nAs we only require data from 2011 to 2020:\r\nClick on “1976 Jan” column, press “shift” key and click on “2010 Dec” column. Right-click on “2010 Dec” column and select “Hide Fields”.\r\nClick on “2021 Jan” column, press “shift” key and click on “2021 Apr” column. Right-click on “2021 Apr” column and select “Hide Fields”.\r\n\r\nTo extract the country/region name, click on the “drop-down” arrow of the “Variables” field -> Split Values -> Automatic Split.\r\n Click on the “drop-down” arrow of the “Variables - Split 1” field -> Rename Field. Rename the column to “Trade partner”. Right-click on “Variables - Split 2” and “Variables” fields to remove them as they are redundant.\r\n\r\nTo keep only the 10 major trade partners, click on the ’drop-down\" arrow of the “Trade partner” field -> Filter -> Selected Values. Check the boxes for the 10 trade partners and click the “Done” button.\r\n\r\nTo transpose the data from a wide form to a long form, click on the “+” button of the “Clean 1” node and select “Pivot”. Select all the month fields and drag them into the “Pivoted Fields” section.\r\n\r\nRight-click on “Pivot1 Values” field to rename it to “Import”. Right-click on “Pivot1 Names” field to rename it to “Month” and click on the “ABC” button to change the field type to “Date”.\r\n\r\nRepeat all the steps above for T2. Rename “Pivot Values” field to “Export”\r\n\r\nTo perform a full join for both Import and Export tables, click on the “+” button\" of “Pivot1” node and select “Join”. Click and drag “Pivot3” node into “Add” of the “Join” node. For the “Join Settings”:\r\nApplied Join Clauses: Select “Trade partner” and “Month”\r\nJoin Type: Select “full”\r\n\r\nClick on the “+” button of “Join 1” node to add a “Clean Step”. Click on “Month-1” field, press “Ctrl” key, click on “Month” field, right-click and select “Merge”. Do the same to merge “Trade partner-1” and “Trade partner” fields.\r\n\r\nClick on the ‘+’ button of the “Clean 3” node and select “Output” to save the output as a “tradepartners.csv” file.\r\n\r\n3.2 Creating bubbleplot in Tableau\r\nOpen Tableau 2021.1. Click and drag “tradepartners.csv” into the workspace.\r\nTo build foundation scatter plot\r\nIn “Sheet 1”, start by building the foundation scatter plot:\r\nClick and drag “Export” pill into “Column”\r\nClick and drag “Import” pill into “Row”\r\n\r\nClick and drag the “Month” pill into the “Filters” pane. Select “Years” and click “Next”. Click “All”, “Apply” and “OK”.\r\n\r\nClick on the drop-down arrow of the “YEAR(Month)” pill and select “Show Filter”, which will appear on the right-hand side. Click on the drop-down arrow of the “YEAR(Month)” filter and select “Single value (list)” so that user may choose only one year at a time.\r\n\r\nFrom the Toolbar header, click “Analysis” -> “Create Calculated Field”. Enter the following formula to create a “Trade value” pill under the “Data” pane.\r\n\r\nClick and drag the “Trade value” pill into “Size” under the “Marks” pane. Click and drag the “Trade partner” pill into “Color” under the “Marks” pane. Change the mark from “Automatic” to “Circle”. On the right-hand side, click the drop-down arrow for “SUM(Trade value)” and select “Hide card”.\r\n\r\nIn the “Marks” pane, click on the “Size” button and use the slider to make the bubbles bigger. In the same pane, click on the “Color” button to change the opacity to 50% and select a grey border for the bubbles.\r\n\r\nTo create diagonal reference line\r\nRight-click on the y-axis and select “Edit”. Select “Fixed” range from “0 to 80,000,000,000” and revise the “Axis Title” to “Import (S$ )”. Right-click on the x-axis and select “Edit”. Select “Fixed” range from “0 to 80,000,000,000” and revise the “Axis Title” to “Export (S$ )”.\r\n\r\nClick and drag “Import” pill into the “Columns”.\r\n\r\nClick on the drop-down arrow of the most recent “SUM(Import)” pill and select “Dual Axis” and “Synchronise”.\r\n\r\nIn the “Marks” pane, click on the “SUM(Import)” tab. Click on the “Size” button and slide to 0. Click on the “Color” button and set 0% opacity and border “None”.\r\n\r\nIn the “Marks” pane, click on the “All” tab. Click and drag the “Measure Names” pill out to remove it.\r\n\r\nIn the “Marks” pane, click on the “SUM(Import)” tab again. On the graph, right-click on the blank space -> “Trend Lines” -> “Show Trend Lines” -> “SUM(Import)”.\r\n\r\nTo recover the bubbles\r\nIn the “Marks” pane, click on the “SUM(Export)” tab. Click on the “Size” button and use the slider to make the bubbles bigger.\r\n\r\nTo give a title with dynamic year to visualisation\r\nDouble click on the “Sheet 1” title field and edit the title as follows. Click on “Insert” -> “YEAR(Month)” to make the year in the title dynamic. Click “Apply” and “OK”.\r\n\r\nTo annotate areas of the graph\r\nRight-click on the top left of the graph and select “Annotate” -> “Area…”. Type in “Negative trade balance” and click “Apply” and “OK”. Under “Format Annotation”, select “None” for “Box Shading” so that it is transparent. Right-click on the bottom right of the graph and perform the same steps to create “Positive trade balance”.\r\n\r\nTo create Tooltips\r\nFrom the Toolbar header, click “Analysis” -> “Create Calculated Field”. Enter the following formula to create a “Trade balance” pill under the “Data” pane.\r\n\r\nRight-click on the newly created “Trade balance” pill and select “Format”. Select “Currency(Custom)”, 0 decimal places and negative values.\r\n In the “Marks” pane, click on the “Tooltips” button. Revise the tooltip as follows. Use the “Insert” button for dynamic fields. Click “Apply” and “OK”.\r\n\r\nTo create animation\r\nFrom the Toolbar header, click “Format” -> “Animations…”. Click “On” for “Workbook Default” and set “Duration” as “Slow”.\r\n\r\n3.3 Creating dashboard in Tableau\r\nClick on “New dashboard” button at the bottom of the window. Click and drag “Bubbleplot” sheet into the dashboard. Add a “Text” box to provide the definition of the European Union. Add “Blank” object boxes to realign all elements of the dashboard. Select “Automatic” for “Size”.\r\n\r\n4 Three major observations\r\n4.1 Singapore maintains a positive trade balance with Mainland China over the past decade\r\nUsing the interactive dashboard, we can observe that the total trade value bubble for Mainland China (in green) consistently remains on the top corner of the “Positive trade balance” region of the graph from 2011 to 2020. Both Singapore’s exports to and imports from Mainland China remain high compared to the other nine trade partners throughout the past decade.\r\n4.2 Singapore maintains a positive trade balance with Hong Kong over the past decade\r\nUsing the interactive dashboard, we can observe that the total trade value bubble for Hong Kong (in orange) moving horizontally above the x-axis in the bottom right corner of the “Positive trade balance” region from 2011 to 2020. Contrary to Mainland China, Singapore’s imports from Hong Kong consistently remains around SGD 5 billion, whereas its exports fluctuate between SGD 55 to 60 billion throughout the past decade.\r\n4.3 Singapore reported a positive trade balance with the Republic of Korea (Korea) for the first time in 2017\r\nUsing the interactive dashboard, we can observe that the total trade value bubble for Korea (in purple) crossing the diagonal line (from the “Negative trade balance” to “Positive trade balance” region) for the first time in the past decade in 2017. The size of Singapore’s exports and imports from Korea has remained relatively stable, nonetheless.\r\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\r\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1 Critic\r\nWe will critic the following data visualisation based on clarity and aesthetic.\r\n\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\nThe data visualisation mentions “top six trading countries” without defining what it means – it could refer to either countries Singapore exports the most to, imports the most from, or with the largest net value of export and import.\r\nThe order of the graphs in 2 rows of 3 provides no information on the rank of each trading country.\r\nThe overlapping shaded areas under the line graphs makes it difficult to read the values of import and export for each country.\r\nThe x-axis on the graph for Japan is incorrect because it only shows one period of 2020.\r\n“Month of period” for the x-axis sounds awkward. Each tick on the x-axis could simply indicate the “Month Year”.\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nThe grid lines on the y-axis are too light and it is therefore difficult to read the exact import and export values.\r\nThe absence of ticks on the x-axis of time makes reading the graphs difficult. The ticks should be in the middle of the period (month).\r\nThe width for x-axis (months) are not standardised across all six graphs. Since some graphs are wider than the rest, it is difficult to compare trends or patterns across countries.\r\nThe dual y-axis for values of exports and imports makes it difficult to determine the exact import and export values. For example, when you look at the Dec 2020 value of export to the US, the line of vision to trace back to the relevant y-axis on the left is challenging.\r\n2 Alternative data visualisation\r\nWe propose an alternative data visualisation to strengthen the visualisation in terms of clarity and aesthetics.\r\n2.1 Sketch\r\nA brief sketch of the proposed alternative data visualisation is as follows:\r\n\r\n2.2 Advantages of alternative data visualisation\r\nIt would be more meaningful to look at merchandise exports and imports separately because how much Singapore exports to or imports from a specific country/region depends on different export and import policies.\r\nFor merchandise exports, we will plot a line graph for the export values of six countries that Singapore exports merchandise to the most between 2019 to 2020. A single y-axis for the export value makes it easier to compare Singapore’s export trends across the six countries during the two year period.\r\nFor merchandise imports, we will adopt a similar method as merchandise exports.\r\nThe proposed visualisation clearly distinguishes the top six countries/regions that Singapore exports from the top six countries/regions that Singapore imports from.\r\nThe dot points for each month makes it easier to read the import and export values. Also, the legend is arranged in the same order as the rank of the countries/regions as at Dec 2020 for ease of reading.\r\n2.3 Proposed data visualisation (in Tableau)\r\nUsing Tableau 2021.1, the alternative data visualisation is available for viewing in Tableau Public. A snapshot of the dashboard is as follows:\r\n\r\n3 Guide to prepare data visualisation\r\nDownload the dataset from the Department of Statistics Singapore’s website on Merchandise Trade. Expand the “Merchandise Trade by Region/Market” tab and click on “Download all in Excel”. Retain the file name as “outputFile.xlsx”.\r\n3.1 Data preparation in Tableau Prep\r\nOpen Tableau Prep Builder 2021.1 and click on “Connect” -> To a File: Microsoft Excel.\r\n\r\nCheck the “Use Data Interpreter” box to perform preliminary cleaning on the dataset.\r\n\r\nClick and drag “T1” table into the workspace. Right click and rename it to “Imports”.\r\n\r\nClick on the “+” sign beside “Imports” and select “Add clean”.\r\n\r\nRemove all “Fields” before 2019 Jan and after 2020 Dec.\r\n\r\nTo extract the country/region name, click on the “drop-down” arrow of the “Variables” field -> Split Values -> Automatic.\r\n\r\nTableau Prep will split the “Variables” field into two. Under the “Variables - Split 2” field, right click on “Million” and select “Exclude” as these refer to aggregate values at the regional level. Under the “Variables - Split 1” field, right click on “Total Merchandise Imports” as we do not require this aggregate information for our data visualisation.\r\n\r\nDouble-click on “Variables - Split 1” field to rename it to “Country”. Right-click on “Variables - Split 2” and “Variables” fields to remove them as they are redundant.\r\n\r\nClick on the ‘+’ sign beside “Clean 1” and select “Output” to save the output as a “import.csv” file.\r\n\r\nPerform the above steps for table “T2” and save the output as a “export.csv” file.\r\n3.2 Data preparation in Microsoft Excel\r\nIn Microsoft Excel, open “export.csv” and create a “Total export value 2019-2020” column to aggregate the value for each country/region. Click “Sort” to sort this column in descending order to obtain the top six countries that Singapore exports to.\r\n\r\nOpen “import.csv” and perform the same steps as above to obtain the top six countries that Singapore imports from.\r\n\r\nTranspose the above information into “Month”, “Trade”, “Country/Region” and “Value” and save as “top6traders.xlsx” file.\r\n\r\n3.3 Creating line graphs in Tableau\r\nOpen Tableau. Click and drag “top6traders.xlsx” into the workspace.\r\n\r\nClick and drag the “Trade” and “Month” pills into Columns and “Value” pill into Rows to get the following basic chart.\r\n\r\nClick on the “Trade” pill under Columns and select “Filter”. Check only the “Export” box.\r\n\r\nRename the chart title as follows:\r\n\r\nClick on the “drop-down” arrow in the Legend box and select “Sort” -> Manual. Sort the countries according to the relative rank as at Dec 2020.\r\n\r\nDouble-click on the x-axis and edit the “Title” field to be empty to remove the redundant “Month by Month” header.\r\n\r\nDouble-click on the y-axis and rename the “Title” to “Value (S$)”.\r\n\r\nRename the worksheet tab to “Export”. The final line graph for top six export partners looks as follows:\r\n\r\nRight-click on the “Export” sheet to duplicate it and rename the duplicate to “Import”. Under the Filter panel, change the filter to “Import”.\r\n\r\nPerform the same steps as above to rename the title and sort the Legend. The final line graph for top six export partners looks as follows:\r\n\r\n3.4 Creating dashboard in Tableau\r\nClick on “New dashboard” tab. Click and drag the “Export” and “Import” sheets into the dashboard. Realign the items on the dashboard so that everything is clear. Select “Automatic” as the size.\r\n\r\nThe final dashboard looks as follows:\r\n\r\n4 Three major observations\r\nBased on the alternative data visualisation, we made the following observations:\r\n4.1 Mainland China is Singapore’s top export and import partner\r\nThroughout 2019 and 2020, Singapore exported the most to Mainland China. Between Jan to Apr 2020, Singapore exported only slightly more to Hong Kong than Mainland China.\r\nDuring this two year period, Singapore also imported the most from Mainland China. When imports from Mainland China declined from Apr to June 2020, it appears that Singapore supplemented this with increased imports from Malaysia and Taiwan.\r\n4.2 A general dip in both exports and import between Mar to May 2020\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic impacted both Singapore’s outward and inward trades with all its major partners during the period of border closure.\r\n4.3 Trade with Malaysia most sensitive between Jan to May 2020\r\nAs Singapore’s closest trading partner, we observe that both exports to and imports from Malaysia greatly suffered when our borders closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\r\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
