Each tick on the x-axis could simply indicate the “Month Year”.\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nThe grid lines on the y-axis are too light and it is therefore difficult to read the exact import and export values.\r\nThe absence of ticks on the x-axis of time makes reading the graphs difficult. The ticks should be in the middle of the period (month).\r\nThe width for x-axis (months) are not standardised across all six graphs. Since some graphs are wider than the rest, it is difficult to compare trends or patterns across countries.\r\nThe dual y-axis for values of exports and imports makes it difficult to determine the exact import and export values. For example, when you look at the Dec 2020 value of export to the US, the line of vision to trace back to the relevant y-axis on the left is challenging.\r\n2 Alternative data visualisation\r\nWe propose an alternative data visualisation to strengthen the visualisation in terms of clarity and aesthetics.\r\n2.1 Sketch\r\nA brief sketch of the proposed alternative data visualisation is as follows:\r\n\r\n2.2 Advantages of alternative data visualisation\r\nIt would be more meaningful to look at merchandise exports and imports separately because how much Singapore exports to or imports from a specific country/region depends on different export and import policies.\r\nFor merchandise exports, we will plot a line graph for the export values of six countries that Singapore exports merchandise to the most between 2019 to 2020. A single y-axis for the export value makes it easier to compare Singapore’s export trends across the six countries during the two year period.\r\nFor merchandise imports, we will adopt a similar method as merchandise exports.\r\nThe proposed visualisation clearly distinguishes the top six countries/regions that Singapore exports from the top six countries/regions that Singapore imports from.\r\nThe dot points for each month makes it easier to read the import and export values. Also, the legend is arranged in the same order as the rank of the countries/regions as at Dec 2020 for ease of reading.\r\n2.3 Proposed data visualisation (in Tableau)\r\nUsing Tableau 2021.1, the alternative data visualisation is available for viewing in Tableau Public. A snapshot of the dashboard is as follows:\r\n\r\n3 Guide to prepare data visualisation\r\nDownload the dataset from the Department of Statistics Singapore’s website on Merchandise Trade. Expand the “Merchandise Trade by Region/Market” tab and click on “Download all in Excel”. Retain the file name as “outputFile.xlsx”.\r\n3.1 Data preparation in Tableau Prep\r\nOpen Tableau Prep Builder 2021.1 and click on “Connect” -> To a File: Microsoft Excel.\r\n\r\nCheck the “Use Data Interpreter” box to perform preliminary cleaning on the dataset.\r\n\r\nClick and drag “T1” table into the workspace. Right click and rename it to “Imports”.\r\n\r\nClick on the “+” sign beside “Imports” and select “Add clean”.\r\n\r\nRemove all “Fields” before Jan 2019 and after Dec 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.2 Data preparation in Microsoft Excel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.3 Creating line graphs in Tableau\r\nTesting testing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.4 Creating dashboard in Tableau\r\nTesting testing\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Three major observations\r\nBased on the alternative data visualisation, we made the following observations:\r\n4.1 Observation 1\r\nTesting testing\r\n4.2 Observation 2\r\nTesting testing\r\n4.3 Observation 3\r\nTesting testing\r\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\r\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
