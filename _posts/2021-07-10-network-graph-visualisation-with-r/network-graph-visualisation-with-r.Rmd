```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.retina=3,
                      echo = TRUE, 
                      eval = TRUE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE)
```

### Building blocks of network graph

To build a network graph, the basic building blocks are "nodes" and "edges". The minimum requirements for a simple data table to build a network graph:

* For node data: (unique) ID column
* For edge data: "source" and "target" columns

### Installing tidygraph, ggraph and visNetwork

Use the following code chunk to check if these packages require installation: [tidygraph](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/index.html), [ggraph](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/index.html) and [visNetwork](https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/)

```{r}
packages = c('tidygraph', 'ggraph', 'visNetwork',
             'igraph', 'lubridate', 'clock',
             'tidyverse')
              
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

### Import network data from files

Note that we use read_csv and not read.csv to import the files.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
GAStech_nodes <- read_csv("data/GAStech_email_node.csv")
GAStech_edges <- read_csv("data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv")
```

Take a glimpse of our dataset:

```{r}
glimpse(GAStech_edges)
```

Note that SentDate is in Character data type. So we will use lubridate package to transform SentDate to Date data type in dmy format and create a new field to output "weekday".

```{r}
GAStech_edges$SentDate = dmy(GAStech_edges$SentDate)
GAStech_edges$Weekday = wday(GAStech_edges$SentDate,
                             label = TRUE,
                             abbr = FALSE)
```

Take a glimpse of our transformed dataset:

```{r}
glimpse(GAStech_edges)
```

### Wrangling time attributes

To aggregate the individual emails by date, sender, recipients, main subject and day of the week:

```{r}
GAStech_edges_aggregated <- GAStech_edges %>%
  filter(MainSubject == "Work related") %>% #filter by only work related emails
  group_by(source, target, Weekday) %>%
    summarise(Weight = n()) %>% #create new field 'Weight' (for the edge)
  filter(source!=target) %>% #to retain emails source and target not the same person
  filter(Weight > 1) %>% #we can filter on a field that does not exist yet (Weight)
  ungroup() #important to ungroup() so that the group_by() does not follow through to subsequent analysis
```

Take a glimpse of aggregated dataset (or in R Studio, click on Environment tab and click on Data):

```{r}
glimpse(GAStech_edges_aggregated)
```

Note that the source and target columns are the minimum requirements for a edge dataset.

### Building the network graph

Review reference guide for [tbl_graph()](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/index.html).

```{r}
GAStech_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,
                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated,
                           directed = TRUE)
```

Take a look at GAStech_graph structure (note that we cannot use glimpse() because the datatable of graph is complex)

```{r}
GAStech_graph
```

### Visualising network graph

[ggraph](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Layouts.html) provides different types of network graph layouts.

To plot the basic graph:

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph) +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point()
```

It is currently plot on x and y axis (cartesian plot).

### Changing the default network graph theme

Use theme_graph() to remove the cartesian plot

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) +
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes())

g + theme_graph()
```

### Fruchterman and Reingold layout

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph,
            layout = "fr") + #just insert the abbr of the layout
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes())

g + theme_graph()
```

### Modifying network nodes

To colour each node by their respective departments:

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph,
            layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, size =3))

g + theme_graph()
```

To modify the thickness of the edges by 'weight' variable:

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph,
            layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, size =2))

g + theme_graph()
```

### Create facet graphs

Working with facet_edges()

```{r}
set_graph_style()

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph,
            layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, size =2))

g + facet_edges(~Weekday)
```

To move the legend to the bottom of the graph:

```{r}
set_graph_style()

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph,
            layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, size =2)) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')

g + facet_edges(~Weekday)
```

Working with facet_nodes()

```{r}
set_graph_style()

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph,
            layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, size =2))

g + facet_nodes(~Department) +
  th_foreground(foreground = "grey80",
                border = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

### Calculating centrality

```{r}
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  mutate(betweenness_centrality = centrality_betweenness()) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, 
                  size = betweenness_centrality))
g + theme_graph()
```

We can use centrality to identify important roles within the organisation.

```{r}
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, 
                  size = centrality_betweenness()))

g + theme_graph()
```

### Visualising community

```{r}
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  mutate(community = as.factor(group_edge_betweenness(weights = Weight, directed = TRUE))) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = community))

g + theme_graph()
```

The output network graph is of nodes coloured by community.

We can also facet by community because the community will be saved as an attribute of the node.

### Build an interactive network graph with visNetwork

visNetwork() uses a nodes list and edges list, different from ggraph(). To create 'from' and 'to' columns to prepare data model:

```{r}
GAStech_edges_aggregated <- GAStech_edges %>%
  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c("sourceLabel" = "label")) %>%
  rename(from = id) %>%
  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c("targetLabel" = "label")) %>%
  rename(to = id) %>%
  filter(MainSubject == "Work related") %>%
  group_by(from, to) %>%
    summarise(weight = n()) %>%
  filter(from!=to) %>%
  filter(weight > 1) %>%
  ungroup()

```

Use the code chunk below to view the interactive graph:

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes, GAStech_edges_aggregated)
```

To keep the network static:

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes, GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr")
```

### Working with visual attributes in visNetwork

visNetwork() looks for a field called 'group'  

```{r}
GAStech_nodes <- GAStech_nodes %>%
  rename(group = Department)
```

For visNetwork(), random seed must be defined within visLayout().

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes, GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```

### Interactivity

Use [visOptions()](https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/options.html) to incorporate interactivity features in the graph.

```{r}
visNetwork(GAStech_nodes, GAStech_edges_aggregated) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr") %>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE,
             nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %>% #creates dropdown list to select name
  visLegend() %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)
```

### Data preparation to build bipartite network graph

Refer to in-class notes to prepare data.  

```{r}

```
