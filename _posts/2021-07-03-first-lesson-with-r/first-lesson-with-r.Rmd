```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE)
```

### How to install and launch R packages

The following code chunk installs and launches R packages.

```{r}
packages = c('DT', 'ggiraph',
              'plotly', 'tidyverse')
              
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

### How to import data

The following code chunk imports a .csv datafile. Ensure that the data file (and folder) is saved in the same location (working directory) as this R Markdown document.

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

### Comparing R Graphics and ggplot2
R Graphics:

* simpler code
* very simple visualisation

ggplot2:

* longer code
* highly customisable visualisation

### Layered grammar of graphics
These are the seven essential grammatical elements (first 3 elements are the foundation):

* Data
* Aesthetics *aes()* – How to we want to map visual att with various attributes of the data
* Geometrics *geom_()* – Visual elements such as point, bar, line, polygons, etc.
* Facets
* Statistics
* Coordinates
* Themes

### How to call the ggplot function
Use the *data argument* as an input to call the ggplot function

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data)
```

### How to use aes()
```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = MATHS))
```

### How to use geom_bar()
```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = RACE)) +
  geom_bar()
```

### How to use geom_dotplot()
```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)
```

<br> We make some refinement with the following changes to input arguments for geom_dotplot() and scale_y_continuous().

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,
               dotsize = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,
                     breaks = NULL)
```

### How to separate the dotplot by race
Use the data argument "fill" in aes() as follows:

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS,
        fill = RACE)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,
               dotsize = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,
                     breaks = NULL)
```

### How to define a different colour for entire graph
Use the data argument "fill" in geom_histogram() as follows:

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20,
                 color = "black", # border colour
                 fill = "light blue")
```

### How to create stacked barchart by gender
Use the data argument "fill" in aes() as follows:

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS,
       fill = GENDER)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20,
                 color = "grey30")
```

Note the different impact on the graphs when data argument "fill" is used in aes() or geom_histogram().

### How plot different geom objects together

Note that the order of plotting the geom objects matters. Plot a geom object that covers an area first so that it does not "cover" subsequent geom objects.

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(x = GENDER,
       y = MATHS)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(position = "jitter", 
             size = 0.5)
# jitter randomly distributes data points to have a sense of how sparse
```

### Interactive data visualisation - ggiraph methods
ggiraph supports three types of interactivity:

* Tooltip
* Onclick
* Data_id

Generally, no changes are required to the aesthetics created on the static graph using ggplot2. However, we need to change to geom_dotplot_interactive().

### How to create an interactive dotplot (tooltip)

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(tooltip = ID),
                           stackgroups = TRUE,
                           binwidth = 1,
                           method = "histodot") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(
  ggobj = p,
  width_svg = 6,
  height_svg = 6*0.618
)
```

### How to create a hover effect with data_id aesthetic

On mouse hover on a student data point, the student's classmates will be highlighted.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(data_id = CLASS),
                           stackgroups = TRUE,
                           binwidth = 1,
                           method = "histodot") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(
  ggobj = p,
  width_svg = 6,
  height_svg = 6*0.618
)
```

We can combine data_id and tooltip as follows:

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(data_id = CLASS,
                               tooltip = CLASS),
                           stackgroups = TRUE,
                           binwidth = 1,
                           method = "histodot") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(
  ggobj = p,
  width_svg = 6,
  height_svg = 6*0.618
)
```

### How to create a hyperlink

Web document link with a data object will be displayed on the web browser when clicked.

```{r}
exam_data$onclick <- sprintf("window.open(\"%s%s\")",
"https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder?journey=Primary%20school", as.character(exam_data$ID))
p <- ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(onclick = onclick),
                           stackgroups = TRUE,
                           binwidth = 1,
                           method = "histodot") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(
  ggobj = p,
  width_svg = 6,
  height_svg = 6*0.618)
```

### How to create interactive scatter plot using plot_ly()

The syntax of plot_ly() is similar to ggplot. Note the curly dash in front of the field name. For more information on working with different arguments of plotly, refer to [Plotly for R](https://plotly.com/r/).

```{r}
plot_ly(data = exam_data, 
            x = ~MATHS, 
            y = ~ENGLISH)
```

The immediate advantage of plotly is the mouse hover toolbar on top right-hand side of the plot:

* Download plot as png file
* Box and lasso selection
* Compare data on hover

### How to work with visual variable

For categorical data, different color for different categories. For numerical data, color will be on a gradient scheme.

```{r}
plot_ly(data = exam_data, 
            x = ~ENGLISH, 
            y = ~MATHS,
            color = ~RACE)
```

The legend is also interactive.

### How to change the colour palette

The following code chunk uses ColourBrewer:

```{r}
plot_ly(data = exam_data, 
            x = ~ENGLISH, 
            y = ~MATHS,
            color = ~RACE,
            colors = "Set1")
```

The following code chunk defines your own colour scheme.

```{r}
pal <- c("red", "blue", "green", "purple") # This R object is a list of colours that should be mapped with the same number of classes of race.

plot_ly(data = exam_data, 
            x = ~ENGLISH, 
            y = ~MATHS,
            color = ~RACE,
            colors = pal)
```
### How to customise the tooltip

```{r}
plot_ly(data = exam_data, 
            x = ~ENGLISH, 
            y = ~MATHS,
            text = ~paste("Student ID:", ID,
                          "<br>Class:", CLASS),
#<br> returns a next line
            color = ~RACE,
            colors = "Set1")
```

Notice that the tooltip will automatically:

* Switch sides to where there is more empty space
* Follow the same colour of the data point.

Also, the font colour of the tooltip text will automatically contrast against the tooltip box.

### How to add a title to the visualisation

```{r}
plot_ly(data = exam_data, 
            x = ~ENGLISH, 
            y = ~MATHS,
            text = ~paste("Student ID:", ID,
                          "<br>Class:", CLASS),
            color = ~RACE,
            colors = "Set1") %>%
  layout(title = 'English score versus Maths score',
         xaxis = list(range = c(0,100)),
         yaxis = list(range = c(0,100)))
  
```

### How to create interactive scatter plot using ggplotly()

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
            aes(x = MATHS, y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100))
ggplotly(p)

```

Notice that you cannot use geom_point() with ggplotly().

### How to work with subplots or multiple plots

For more information, refer to [Plotly R Library Subplots and Multiple Axes](https://plotly.com/r/subplot-charts/). 

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
            aes(x = MATHS, y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100))

p2 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
            aes(x = MATHS, y = SCIENCE)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100))

subplot(ggplotly(p1),
        ggplotly(p2))
```

Note that subplot is simply plotting two graphs side by side.

### To create coordinated multiple linked view

We use highlight_key() as a wrapper for crosstalk::SharedData.

```{r}
d <- highlight_key(exam_data)

p1 <- ggplot(data=d, 
            aes(x = MATHS, y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100))

p2 <- ggplot(data=d, 
            aes(x = MATHS, y = SCIENCE)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100))

subplot(ggplotly(p1),
        ggplotly(p2))
```

### How to create an interactive data table

We use DT package to create a dynamic data table without the typical hassle of working in html. For more information, refer to [DT in R]().

```{r}
DT::datatable(exam_data)
```

Be mindful of relevant variables to showcase in the DT table. If too many columns, consider using a heatmap instead.

### How to create linked brushing using crosstalk

Linked brushing allows you to select datapoints from a graph and outputs the corresponding data rows in the DT table.

It is very useful for data exploration.

```{r}
d <- highlight_key(exam_data)
#highlight_key defines the crosstalk, i.e. shared data

p <- ggplot(d, 
            aes(x = ENGLISH, y = MATHS)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100))

gg <- highlight(ggplotly(p),
                "plotly_selected")
#highlight defines the brushing feature we want to implement, i.e. to highlight the selected area

crosstalk::bscols(gg,
                  DT::datatable(d),
                  widths = 5)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
